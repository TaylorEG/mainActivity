* Fork this repository to your own Github account

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/global2local-android.git`
* Setup remote repo with the original repo as the target


`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/evantaurusta/global2local-android.git`
* Do `$ git remote -v` -> your remote setup should appear similar to this


`origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/PROJECT_USERNAME/PROJECT.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/PROJECT_USERNAME/PROJECT.git (push)`

## Helpful git command ##

* `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` to create *local* branch
* `git branch` list all the branch in your local repo
* `git branch -D BRANCH_NAME` delete local branch in your machine
* `git push origin --delete BRANCH_NAME` delete remote branch on github

**you are allowed to use SourceTree as the GUI client for git, it still work with github repo. However,
It's encourage(not by me) to 
know the command lines functions**
